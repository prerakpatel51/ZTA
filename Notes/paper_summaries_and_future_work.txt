PAPER 1 SUMMARY

Title: Zero trust-based authentication for Inter-Satellite Links in NextGen
       Low Earth Orbit networks
Authors: Farrea et al. (2025)

What it does:
- Proposes a Zero Trust authentication protocol for LEO satellite networks
- Uses satellite orbital parameters (position, velocity, time) to verify
  satellite identity
- Uses Hyperelliptic Curve Cryptography (HECC) for lightweight security

How it works:
- Four phases: Setup, Pre-negotiation, Mutual Authentication, Continuous Auth
- Satellites generate Physical State Keys from their orbital coordinates
- Dynamic temporary IDs protect satellite identity
- Continuous authentication keeps verifying throughout the session


Phase 1 - Initial Configuration:
   Step 1: Cloud server (NCC) generates system parameters and keys
   Step 2: NCC creates temporary identities for each satellite
   Step 3: NCC sends encrypted parameters to satellites via TLS
   Step 4: Each satellite verifies NCC and generates its own temporary ID
   Step 5: Satellites send confirmation back to NCC
   Step 6: NCC verifies and confirms mutual authentication

Phase 2 - Pre-Negotiation:
   Step 1: Satellite B senses Satellite A in range
   Step 2: Satellite B sends handover request with its temporary ID
   Step 3: Satellite A verifies and forwards request to NCC
   Step 4: NCC retrieves orbital parameters for both satellites
   Step 5: NCC sends encrypted orbital data to both satellites
   Step 6: Satellites store the parameters for authentication

Phase 3 - Mutual Authentication:
   Step 1: Satellite A calculates its position from orbital parameters
   Step 2: Satellite A generates Physical State Key from position
   Step 3: Satellite A derives Confidentiality Key and Integrity Key
   Step 4: Satellite A creates Message Authentication Code (MAC)
   Step 5: Satellite A sends Authentication Vector to Satellite B
   Step 6: Satellite B verifies by recalculating expected values
   Step 7: Satellite B repeats same steps and sends its vector to A
   Step 8: Both satellites are now mutually authenticated

Phase 4 - Continuous Authentication:
   Step 1: Satellites monitor changes in environment and position
   Step 2: At regular intervals, generate new temporary identities
   Step 3: Create Continuous Authentication Token with timestamp
   Step 4: Exchange encrypted tokens between satellites
   Step 5: Verify received tokens and update identity records
   Step 6: Send acknowledgment to confirm session continues
   Step 7: NCC periodically triggers key updates for fresh keys

Validation:
- Tested with Scyther and BAN Logic for security
- Simulated with MATLAB and STK for performance
- Works for constellations up to 1200 satellites

Main benefit:
- Reduces communication overhead by 64-98% compared to existing methods
- Does not rely heavily on ground stations


PAPER 2 SUMMARY

Title: Identity authentication for edge devices based on zero-trust architecture
Authors: Liu et al. (2022)

What it does:
- Proposes authentication protocols for edge computing devices
- Supports both local authentication and roaming authentication
- Uses group signatures so devices can authenticate anonymously

How it works:
- Devices get keys with expiration times built in
- When a key expires, it automatically becomes invalid
- Uses binary tree structure to manage revocation efficiently
- Roaming protocol allows devices to authenticate with foreign servers

Local Authentication (Step by Step):
System Setup:
   Step 1: Cloud server selects cryptographic groups and generators
   Step 2: Cloud server generates master public key and private key
   Step 3: Public parameters are shared with all edge servers and devices
   Step 4: Registry is initialized to store device information

Device Joining:
   Step 1: Edge device generates a secret key
   Step 2: Device proves knowledge of secret to edge server
   Step 3: Edge server assigns expiration time to device
   Step 4: Edge server creates BBS+ signatures for the device
   Step 5: Device receives signature key with expiration embedded
   Step 6: Edge server stores revocation token in registry

Signing (Authentication):
   Step 1: Device checks if current time is before expiration
   Step 2: Device encrypts its signature components
   Step 3: Device creates zero-knowledge proof of valid membership
   Step 4: Device generates signature on the message
   Step 5: Signature is sent to verifier (edge server)

Verification:
   Step 1: Verifier checks if signature format is valid
   Step 2: Verifier runs verification equations
   Step 3: If device might be revoked early, check revocation list
   Step 4: Output valid only if all checks pass

Revocation:
   Step 1: For expired devices - automatically invalid (no list needed)
   Step 2: For early revocation - add token to revocation list
   Step 3: Use complete subtree algorithm to manage expired nodes

How it works - Roaming Authentication (Step by Step):

Pre-Negotiation:
   Step 1: Device selects random number for key agreement
   Step 2: Device signs the pre-negotiation message
   Step 3: Device sends message to foreign server
   Step 4: Foreign server verifies timestamp and signature
   Step 5: Foreign server caches the message for later use

Authentication:
   Step 1: Device sends home server ID and temporary pseudonym to foreign server
   Step 2: Foreign server generates its own random number
   Step 3: Foreign server signs and sends response to device
   Step 4: Device verifies foreign server signature
   Step 5: Device generates group signature for authentication
   Step 6: Device encrypts signature with session key and sends it
   Step 7: Foreign server decrypts and verifies group signature
   Step 8: If valid, session key is established and connection accepted


Validation:
- Security proven mathematically (backward unlinkability, traceability)
- Compared with three other protocols
- Shows better revocation checking performance over time

Main benefit:
- Expired devices dont need to be added to revocation list
- Reduces overhead when checking if devices are revoked


FUTURE WORK IDEAS

1. Satellite-Edge Integration
   - Paper 1 handles satellites, Paper 2 handles edge devices
   - Could combine them for scenarios where edge devices connect via satellites
   - Handle handover when device moves from ground network to satellite coverage

2. Better Revocation for Satellites
   - Paper 1 doesnt fully address what happens when a satellite is compromised
   - Could adapt the revocation approach from Paper 2 for satellite networks

3. Reduce Device-Side Authentication Time
   - Paper 2 takes about 6 seconds for device authentication
   - This is too slow for many real-time applications
   - Need optimization for faster authentication

4 Use same concept as paper 1 for the inter-drone connection
   - We can use IR beacon and Drectional antennas working on frequency hopping
   - Or use Lasers/IR for connection between them hard but thinkable when case of jamming.

5. Test with Real Hardware
   - Both papers use simulations
   - Need testing on actual satellite hardware and edge devices
   - Verify that theoretical performance matches real-world results

6. Handle Network Interruptions
   - What happens when satellite link drops during authentication?
   - Need graceful recovery mechanisms

7. Quantum Security
   - Both papers mention quantum computing as a threat
   - Paper 1 uses HECC which helps but isnt fully quantum-resistant
   - Need to explore lattice-based alternatives
