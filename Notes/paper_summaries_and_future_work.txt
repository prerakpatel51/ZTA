PAPER 1: Zero Trust-based Authentication for Inter-Satellite Links in NextGen Low Earth Orbit Networks
Authors: Farrea et al. (2025)
	•	Main Contribution: The paper introduces a Zero Trust authentication protocol for Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites, focusing on Inter-Satellite Links (ISLs) and using orbital parameters (position, velocity, time) to validate satellite identities. The protocol incorporates Hyperelliptic Curve Cryptography (HECC) to offer lightweight security.
	•	Key Features:
	•	Phase 1: Initial Configuration for generating system parameters and temporary satellite IDs.
	•	Phase 2: Pre-Negotiation for secure communication between satellites, ensuring the correct exchange of orbital parameters.
	•	Phase 3: Mutual Authentication between satellites, generating Physical State Keys and MACs for secure data exchange.
	•	Phase 4: Continuous Authentication via periodically updated temporary identities to maintain session security.
	•	Security Assurance: HECC ensures that minimal computational resources are used while providing strong encryption.
	•	Validation: Security was verified using Scyther, BAN Logic, and simulations with MATLAB and STK, showing a 64-98% reduction in communication overhead compared to traditional methods.
	•	Main Benefit: The protocol improves security by removing dependency on ground stations, reducing latency and making it more efficient for large satellite constellations.

	•	Main Contribution: Proposes an enhanced Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) for satellite networks, incorporating edge intelligence and continuous authentication to enhance security in LEO satellite systems.
	•	Key Features:
	•	Multi-Dimensional ZTA: Expands Zero Trust principles to include subject, object, environment, behavior, and physical entity dimensions for better security coverage.
	•	Continuous Authentication: Devices undergo periodic re-authentication during a session using Neural-Backed Decision Trees (NBDTs), improving accuracy.
	•	Edge Intelligence: Supports decision-making for real-time authentication and minimizes overhead in satellite networks.
	•	Validation: Simulated using STK and MATLAB, showing a 27% improvement in authentication accuracy over traditional methods.
	•	Main Benefit: Provides secure and low-latency authentication for dynamic satellite networks, critical for next-generation (6G) satellite systems.

Future Work Expansion
	1.	Optimization of Authentication Speed
	•	Authentication times in Paper 2 (about 6 seconds) may be too slow for real-time applications.
	•	Optimizing authentication algorithms can reduce authentication times while maintaining high security and ensuring low-latency in environments like autonomous systems.
	2.	Inter-Drone Authentication
	•	Use the same Zero Trust principles for drone networks. Integrate directional antennas or IR beams for secure inter-drone communication.
	•	Continuous authentication could ensure drone communication integrity, especially in high-interference environments (e.g., frequency hopping or laser/IR connections).
	3.	Real-World Testing on Satellite Hardware
	•	Simulations (MATLAB, STK) in Paper 1 and Paper 4 need to be validated on real satellite hardware. This will ensure that the proposed authentication protocols are practical and scalable under real operational conditions.
	4.	Quantum Security
	•	Quantum computing threats need to be addressed, especially since HECC in Paper 1 is not fully quantum-resistant.
	•	Research into quantum-resistant algorithms (e.g., lattice-based encryption, quantum key distribution (QKD)) should be prioritized to future-proof these authentication protocols.
